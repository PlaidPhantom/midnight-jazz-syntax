# Midnight Jazz syntax theme

I am a visual person. I like to glance over the screen and instantly get a sense of the structure of the code, and I like it when I can skim over code and find what I want without having to slow down and pick through the tokens.  My screens have millions of colors and I'm going to put them to use!  I love the rigor that was put into picking the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color scheme, so I wanted to take those colors and use them to their fullest extent.

I've made sure the theme works with a number of language parsers, but I'm sure there's plenty of enhancements that could be made.  Suggestions and contributions are totally welcome!

All that said, Watch the sunset, turn down the lights, and let the [music wash over you](http://somafm.com/).
