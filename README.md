# Midnight Jazz syntax theme

I love [Lunarized](https://github.com/aclissold/lunarized-syntax), but I wanted a little more pop in the highlighting, so I decided to throw in a little extra kick.  (For example, HTML and CSS have their own distinct palettes.)   [Watch the sunset](https://github.com/atom/solarized-dark-syntax), turn down the lights, and let the [music](http://somafm.com/) wash over you.

So far I've mostly focused on HTML, CSS, Javascript as those are the languages I primarily use in Atom; suggestions and contributions, particularly for other languages, are very welcome!
